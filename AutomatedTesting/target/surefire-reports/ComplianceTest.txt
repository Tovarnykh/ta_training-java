ruleStreams  Time elapsed: 0.769 s  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: Rule 'no classes should call method where target Methods Collection#stream() should not be used' failed to check any classes. This means either that no classes have been passed to the rule at all, or that no classes passed to the rule matched the `that()` clause. To allow rules being evaluated without checking any classes you can either use `ArchRule.allowEmptyShould(true)` on a single rule or set the configuration property `archRule.failOnEmptyShould = false` to change the behavior globally.

ruleSort  Time elapsed: 0 s  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: Rule 'no classes should call method where target There is no adequate reason to use Collection#sort(), use sorting containers instead.' failed to check any classes. This means either that no classes have been passed to the rule at all, or that no classes passed to the rule matched the `that()` clause. To allow rules being evaluated without checking any classes you can either use `ArchRule.allowEmptyShould(true)` on a single rule or set the configuration property `archRule.failOnEmptyShould = false` to change the behavior globally.

noAdditionalFields  Time elapsed: 0 s  <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: Rule 'classes that have name BookCatalog should not add additional fields.' failed to check any classes. This means either that no classes have been passed to the rule at all, or that no classes passed to the rule matched the `that()` clause. To allow rules being evaluated without checking any classes you can either use `ArchRule.allowEmptyShould(true)` on a single rule or set the configuration property `archRule.failOnEmptyShould = false` to change the behavior globally.
